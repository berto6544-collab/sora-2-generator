## 📝 Prompt Best‑Practice Tips  
- **Be specific**: describe characters, setting, camera angle/movement, lighting, emotion.  
- **Mention motion**: e.g., “camera dolly in”, “wide tracking shot”, “slow‑motion pan”.  
- **Use reference image** when you want consistency in visual style or character design.  
- **Choose correct format** for your target platform (vertical for mobile, horizontal for YouTube).  
- **Iterate**: generate → review → tweak prompt/image → regenerate until result matches your vision.
